# ðŸŒ„ Regularization Images
Pre-Rendered Regularization Images fou use with fine-tuning, especially for the current implementation of "Dreambooth".

## What are Regularization Images?
Regularization images are images that are used as part of a regularization process to improve the stability and performance of deep learning models. In the context of stable diffusion and the current implementation of Dreambooth, regularization images are used to encourage the model to make smooth, predictable predictions, and to improve the quality and consistency of the output images, respectively.

## Available Image Sets
This repository hosts a variety of different sets of regularization images. While these images worked for the author of this repository, they should in no way be considered "best practice".

Your feedback in form of issues is much appreciated!
